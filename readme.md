# 🥗 NutriPath — Smart Diet & Macro Calculator

**Your Personalized Path to Smarter Eating**

NutriPath is a Streamlit web app that calculates your daily calorie needs, macronutrient targets, hydration, fibre, and BMI — then generates a detailed, downloadable PDF nutrition report tailored to your goals.

- **Full macro breakdown** — protein, fats, carbs, fibre, and water, with an interactive donut chart
- **BMI calculator** with healthy weight range and category (Underweight / Normal / Overweight / Obese)
- **Per-meal breakdown** based on how many meals you eat per day
- **Estimated goal timeline** for reaching your target weight safely

## 🖼️ How It Works

| Input | Used For |
|---|---|
| Age, gender, weight, height | BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate) via Mifflin-St Jeor equation |
| Activity level | TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure) multiplier |
| Current vs. goal weight | Determines calorie deficit, surplus, or maintenance |
| Goal weight | Protein target (1.9 g/kg of goal weight) |
| Current weight | Fat target (0.7 g/kg of current weight) and water target (35 ml/kg) |
| Meals per day | Per-meal calorie and protein split |
